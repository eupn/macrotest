//! #### &emsp; Test harness for macro expansion.
//!
//! Similar to [trybuild], but allows you to write tests on how macros are expanded.
//!
//! <br>
//!
//! # Macro expansion tests
//!
//! A minimal `macrotest` setup looks like this:
//!
//! ```rust
//! #[test]
//! pub fn pass() {
//!     let t = macrotest::TestCases::new();
//!     t.pass("tests/expand/*.rs");
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The test can be run with `cargo test`. It will individually extract each of
//! the source files matches the glob pattern as `main.rs` in a separate `cargo` crate in
//! temporary folder and will invoke `cargo expand` to expand macro invocations.
//!
//! Project's crate will listed under `[dependencies]` section of temporary crates and will be
//! available from the test cases.
//!
//! Expansion result is compared with the corresponding `.expanded.rs` file (same file name as
//! the test except with a different extension). If file doesn't exists, it will create a new one
//! (this is how you update your tests).
//!
//! Possible test outcomes are:
//! - **Pass**: expansion succeeded and result is the same as in `.expanded.rs` file
//! - **Fail**: expansion is different from the `.expanded.rs` file content. This will print a diff
//! - **Refresh**: `.expanded.rs` didn't exist and has been created
//!
//! *NB*: after execution of each test, a temporary folder with the crate is removed automatically.
//!
//! # Workflow
//!
//! First of all, the `cargo-expand` tool must be present. You can install it via cargo:
//!
//! ```bash
//! cargo install cargo-expand
//! ```
//!
//! A **nigthly** compiler is required for this tool to operate, so it must be installed as well.
//!
//! `cargo-expand` uses [`rustfmt`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt) to format expanded code.
//! It's advised to install it, since examples in `test-project/` and `test-procmacro-project/`
//! folders are using formatted version of expanded code to compare with.
//!
//! ## Setting up a test project
//!
//! Inside your crate that provides procedural or declarative macros, create a test case
//! under `tests` directory.
//!
//! Under the `tests` directory create an `expand` directory and populate it with
//! different expansion test cases as Rust source files.
//!
//! Then, udner the `tests` directory, create `tests.rs` file that will run the tests:
//!
//! ```rust
//! #[test]
//! pub fn pass() {
//!     let t = macrotest::TestCases::new();
//!     t.pass("tests/expand/*.rs");
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! And then you can run `cargo test` to
//!
//! 1. For the first time, generate the `.expanded.rs` files for each of the test cases under
//! the `expand` directory
//! 1. After that, test cases' expansion result will be compared with the
//! content of `.expanded.rs` files
//!
//! ## Updating `.expanded.rs`
//!
//! Just remove the `.expanded.rs` files and re-run the corresponding tests. Files will be created
//! automatically; hand-writing them is not recommended.
//!
